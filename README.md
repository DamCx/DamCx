- 👋 Hi, I’m Damien CACHEUX / @DamCx
- 👀 I’m interested in Java, mostly backend development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning astrophotography (I know, not really linked with IT, but that's a huge passion of mine)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Maven as this ASF project is my best discovery of the 10 last years.
- 📫 How to reach me: Twitter [@DamienCacheux](https://twitter.com/DamienCacheux)
